# Overview

To efficiently maintain the observability and security configurations in Dynatrace weâ€™ve decided to integrate Monaco into our CI/CD pipeline, the monitoring as code CLI tool created and recommended by Dynatrace.

Monaco utilizes configuration files that allow us to create, update, and manage our configurations safely, consistenty and repetitively. They can be reused, versioned and shared within our team.
Because of the use of configuration files, it is fairly easy for other development teams to define configuration to be checked into version control through GitHub.
